                   to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains
                   anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of
                   Netflix, the world's largest online movie rental

                   only a little bit about an individual subscriber can
                   easily identify this subscriber's record in the

  abstract =      {The proliferation of information on the Internet and
                   access to fast computers with large storage
                   capaci-ties has increased the volume of information
                   collected and disseminated about individuals. The
                   existence os these other data sources makes it much
                   easier to re-identify individuals whose private
                   information is released in data believed to be
                   anonymous. At the same time, increasing demands are
                   made on organi-zations to release individualized data
                   rather than aggregate statistical information. Even
                   when explicit identi ers, such as name and phone
                   number, are removed or encrypted when releasing
                   individualized data, other characteristic data, which
                   we term quasi-identiers, can exist which allow the
                   data recipient to re-identify individuals to whom the
                   data refer. In this paper, we provide a computational
                   disclosure technique for releasing information from a
                   private table such that the identity of any
                   individual to whom the released data refer cannot be
                   denitively recognized. Our approach protects against
                   linking to other data. It is based on the concepts of
                   gen-eralization, by which stored values can be
                   replaced with semantically consistent and truthful
                   but less precise alternatives, and of k-anonymity. A
                   table is said to provide k-anonymity when the
                   contained data do not allow the recipient to
                   associate the released information to a set of

  abstract =      {Publishing data about individuals without revealing
                   sensitive information about them is an important
                   problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy
                   called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a
                   k-anonymized dataset, each record is
                   indistinguishable from at least k - 1 other records
                   with respect to certain identifying attributes. In
                   this article, we show using two simple attacks that a
                   k-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe
                   privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the
                   values of sensitive attributes when there is little
                   diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a
                   known problem. Second, attackers often have
                   background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity
                   does not guarantee privacy against attackers using
                   background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of
                   these two attacks, and we propose a novel and
                   powerful privacy criterion called
                   {$\mathscr{l}$}-diversity that can defend against
                   such attacks. In addition to building a formal
                   foundation for {$\mathscr{l}$}-diversity, we show in
                   an experimental evaluation that
                   {$\mathscr{l}$}-diversity is practical and can be
                   implemented efficiently.},
